This report presents the design and implementation of a prototype Smart Parking System utilizing
Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to address common urban parking challenges. The system
employs Arduino Uno microcontrollers, infrared (IR) sensors, servo motors, and LED displays to
detect vehicle presence, monitor real-time parking slot availability, and automate barrier control. The
prototype demonstrates how affordable and readily available components can be integrated to create a
scalable, energy-efficient parking management solution suitable for environments such as hospitals,
educational institutions, and public parking areas. By providing real-time visual feedback and
automated guidance, the system aims to minimize the time drivers spend searching for available
spaces, thereby reducing traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and user frustration. The report details
the system architecture, hardware and software components, and testing results, highlighting the
potential for future integration with mobile applications and advanced IoT-based features such as
remote monitoring, automatic billing, and smart navigation. This approach offers a practical, low-cost
alternative to existing complex and expensive parking solutions, with a focus on usability, modularity,
and scalability for modern urban needs.
